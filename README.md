# Baysean-Spam-Filtering-AI
The following is a Baysean Spam Filtering Machine Learning Model that I generated with Google's Gemini AI System to explore the foundations of Machine Learning, including accuracy, precision, and recall.

For this project, I utilized Python's SciKit Library for the basic machine learning fundamentals, including the generation of the report on accuracy and precision, as well as the Bayes' Rule for analyzing each word within the Spam and Ham classes. 

To utilize this program, I recommend downloading the spam.csv file (courtesy of my instructor, Dr. Daniel S. Myers from Rollins College), followed by downloading the bayseanFilter.py file. Doing this in the order specified will prevent errors in finding the spam.csv file.
