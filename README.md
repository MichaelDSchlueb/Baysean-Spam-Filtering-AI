# Baysean-Spam-Filtering-AI

## Overview
This project features a Bayesian Spam Filtering Machine Learning Model, which I developed using Google's Gemini AI system. My goal was to explore foundational machine learning concepts like accuracy, precision, and recall. Inspired by my personal struggle with identifying spam emails, I created this AI solution not only to save time and enhance security but also to dive deep into the world of AI and machine learning.

To get this program up and running:

## Getting Started
1. Download spam.csv: This dataset is courtesy of Dr. Daniel S. Myers from Rollins College.

2. Download bayseanFilter.py:

3. Create a new folder of your choice to store these files in

4. If your program cannot seem to find the spam.csv file, please check to ensure that your program is looking in the correct directory.

**It's crucial to download the spam.csv file first to prevent any errors when the Python script attempts to locate it.**

## Customizing Your Data
To utilize this program, I recommend downloading the spam.csv file (courtesy of my instructor, Dr. Daniel S. Myers from Rollins College), followed by downloading the bayseanFilter.py file. Doing this in the order specified will prevent errors in finding the spam.csv file. 

If, after you use the spam.csv file and wish to try this algorithm with your examples of spam and ham mail, feel free to develop a spreadsheet of your own, including the email address and the messages you wish to use.
